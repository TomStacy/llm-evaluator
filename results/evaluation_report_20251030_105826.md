## üìù Generated Evaluation Questions

### 1. Question by Grok Code Fast 1

- **Generation Time:** 7.33s
- **Tokens Used:** 286 in + 554 out = 840 total
- **Actual Cost:** $0.0009

You are a detective investigating a heist where three suspects (Alex, Blake, and Casey) each made one statement about the crime. You know that exactly one suspect is telling the truth, and the others are lying. The statements are: Alex says, "Blake did it." Blake says, "Casey and I are both innocent." Casey says, "Alex is guilty." Based on this, determine who committed the crime and the truthfulness of each statement. Explain your multi-step reasoning process, including how you rule out possibilities.


### 2. Question by Claude Sonnet 4.5

- **Generation Time:** 8.94s
- **Tokens Used:** 96 in + 305 out = 401 total
- **Actual Cost:** $0.0049

A rectangular swimming pool is being filled by two pipes. Pipe A can fill the pool in 6 hours working alone, while Pipe B can fill it in 4 hours working alone. However, there's a drain at the bottom that can empty the full pool in 12 hours if left open.

The pool operator begins filling the empty pool using both pipes simultaneously with the drain closed. After 1 hour, she realizes the drain was accidentally left open the entire time. She immediately closes the drain and continues filling with both pipes for another hour. At this point, she needs to shut off Pipe A for maintenance, so only Pipe B continues filling (with the drain still closed) until the pool is completely full.

**Part 1:** What fraction of the pool was filled during the first hour (when the drain was open)?

**Part 2:** What fraction of the pool was filled by the end of the second hour?

**Part 3:** How much additional time after the second hour is needed to completely fill the pool using only Pipe B?

**Part 4:** If the operator wanted the pool to be exactly half-full at the end of 2 hours total (starting from empty), and she could choose when to close the drain during those 2 hours, at what time should she close it? Assume both pipes run continuously for the entire 2 hours.

Show your reasoning for each part.


### 3. Question by Gemini 2.5 Flash

A renowned linguist claims that a language's grammatical gender system is inherently tied to its speakers' societal power structures, specifically that languages with more pervasive and complex gender agreement (e.g., affecting nouns, adjectives, and verbs) tend to emerge from historically more hierarchical societies, whereas languages with simpler or absent gender systems arise from more egalitarian ones.

Critically evaluate this hypothesis. Consider the nature of grammatical gender, its historical development, and the complexities of correlating linguistic features with societal structures. You should not merely agree or disagree, but rather explore the strengths and weaknesses of the claim, considering potential counter-examples or alternative explanations for apparent correlations.


### 4. Question by Gemini 2.5 Pro

Consider a hypothetical subterranean civilization whose primary sensory modalities are mechanoreception (detecting ground vibrations of varying frequency and amplitude) and chemoreception (detecting airborne chemical gradients). They have no concept of light or sight.

Your task is to design a system for broadcasting a complex narrative to a large, dispersed audience.

1.  Propose a basic encoding scheme for language using *only one* of the two available senses. Describe how your scheme would represent distinct concepts (e.g., nouns vs. verbs, or specific ideas like 'danger' vs. 'safety').

2.  Based on your choice in step 1, describe a plausible method for broadcasting a message using this scheme across a distance of several kilometers through solid rock and cavern systems.

3.  Identify the single most significant physical challenge that would degrade the fidelity (clarity and accuracy) of your broadcasted message over distance. Then, explain precisely how a secondary, complementary system using the *other* sensory modality could be used to mitigate this specific challenge.


### 5. Question by Grok 4 Fast

- **Tokens Used:** 238 in + 774 out = 1012 total
- **Actual Cost:** $0.0004

Consider three suspects‚ÄîAlice, Bob, and Charlie‚Äîin a robbery where exactly one is guilty. The guilty person always lies in their statements, while the two innocents always tell the truth. Their statements are:

- Alice: "Bob is guilty, and Charlie is innocent."
- Bob: "Neither Alice nor Charlie is guilty."
- Charlie: "Exactly one of Alice's claims is true."

By assuming each person is guilty in turn and checking for consistency across all statements, determine who is guilty and explain the step-by-step reasoning that leads to your conclusion.
