However, if all are L (0 K), A's statement would be true, but L must lie—contradiction. If all are K (3 K), A's statement would be false, but K must tell truth—contradiction. Thus, exactly 1 or 2 K.\n\n2. **Analyze A's Statement**:\n   - If A is K, then \"we are all L\" is true, meaning all are L, but A would be L—contradiction.\n   - Thus, A must be L (to avoid contradiction). As an L, A's statement is false: Not all are L, so at least one is K (confirming 1 or 2 K).\n\n3. **Analyze B's Statement**:\n   - Suppose B is K. Then \"exactly one of us is a K\" is true. Since A is L, the one K must be B, making C an L.\n   - Check C's statement: \"B and I are different types.\" B is K, C is L—different, so true. But C is L, who must lie, so C cannot make a true statement—contradiction.\n   - Thus, B cannot be K and must be L. As an L, B's statement is false: Not exactly one K, so exactly 2 K (since 0 and 3 are impossible).\n\n4. **Determine the Types**:\n   - Knights: 2. Knaves: 1 (A and B).\n   - A is L (as established).\n   - B is L (as established).\n   - C must be K (the remaining Knight).\n   - Verify C's statement: \"B and I are different types.\" B is L, C is K—different, and true. Since C is K, this is consistent.\n\n5. **Check for Contradictions or Assumptions**:\n   - No other configurations",

         "# Solution: Determining Knights and Knaves\n\nLet me work through this systematically by analyzing each statement and testing possibilities.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze A's Statement\n\n**A says: \"We are all Knaves.\"**\n\nLet's test if A could be a Knight:\n- If A is a Knight, then A tells the truth\n- So \"We are all Knaves\" would be true\n- But this creates a contradiction: A cannot be both a Knight (our assumption) and a Knave (what the statement claims)\n- **Therefore, A must be a Knave**\n\nSince A is a Knave, A's statement is false:\n- \"We are all Knaves\" is false\n- This means **at least one person is a Knight**\n\n## Step 2: Analyze B's Statement\n\n**B says: \"Exactly one of us is a Knight.\"**\n\nWe know A is a Knave. Let's test if B could be a Knight:\n\n**Case 1: B is a Knight**\n- B's statement \"Exactly one of us is a Knight\" would be true\n- We already have B as a Knight, so C must be a Knave\n- Check: A = Knave, B = Knight, C = Knave\n- Count: Exactly 1 Knight ✓\n- This is consistent so far\n\n**Case 2: B is a Knave**\n- B's statement \"Exactly one of us is a Knight\" would be false\n- So either 0 Knights or 2+ Knights exist\n- We know at least one Knight exists (from Step 1)\n- So there must be 2 or 3 Knights\n- But A is a Knave, and B is a Knave (our assumption)\n- So C would need to be a Knight, giving us only 1 Knight\n- This contradicts \"2+ Knights\"\n- **This case is impossible**\n\n**Therefore, B must be a Knight**\n\n## Step 3: Analyze C's Statement\n\n**C says: \"B and I are different types.\"**\n\nWe've established: A = Knave, B = Knight\n\n**Test if C is a Knight:**\n- C's statement would be",

         "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nIn this Knights and Knaves puzzle, Knights always tell the truth, and Knaves always lie. We must evaluate all possible type assignments for A, B, and C (8 combinations total) and check consistency with their statements:\n- A: \"We are all Knaves.\" (True only if A, B, and C are all Knaves.)\n- B: \"Exactly one of us is a Knight.\" (True only if precisely one of A, B, C is a Knight.)\n- C: \"B and I are different types.\" (True only if B and C are one Knight and one Knave.)\n\nI will analyze the cases systematically, starting with whether A is a Knight or Knave, as A's statement provides an immediate constraint. For each case, I check if the statements match the speaker's type (truth for Knight, lie for Knave). If any statement mismatches, the case is invalid.\n\n#### Step 1: A Cannot Be a Knight\nSuppose A is a Knight. Then A's statement (\"all are Knaves\") must be true, meaning A, B, and C are all Knaves. But this contradicts A being a Knight (a truth-teller cannot be a Knave).  \n**Conclusion**: A must be a Knave. (This eliminates 4 cases: A Knight with any combination for B and C. In all such cases, A's statement is false—since A is a Knight, not all are Knaves—but a Knight cannot make a false statement.)\n\nSince A is a Knave, A's statement (\"all are Knaves\") is a lie, so **not all are Knaves** (at least one Knight among A, B, C). But since A is a Knave, the Knight(s) must be among B and/or C. This leaves 4 cases to check.\n\n#### Step 2: Check Remaining Cases (A is Knave)\nWe now evaluate the 4 possible types for (B, C), computing the number of Knights and verifying each statement.\n\n- **Case 1: A Knave, B Knight, C Knight** (2 Knights total: B and C).  \n  - A's statement (\"all Knaves\"): False (2 Knights exist). A is Knave, so lying is correct.  \n  - B's statement (\"exactly one Knight\"): False (2 Knights, not 1). But B is Knight and cannot lie. **Contradiction**.",

This is a contradiction.\n- If A is a Knave (liar): Then A's statement \"We are all Knaves\" is false, meaning it's not true that all three are Knaves.\n\n**Conclusion: A must be a Knave.**\n\n## Step 2: Analyze B's statement\nB says: \"Exactly one of us is a Knight.\"\n\nSince A is a Knave, this statement means exactly one person among {A, B, C} is a Knight. Since A is a Knave, either B or C (but not both) must be the Knight.\n\nLet's test if B could be a Knight:\n- If B is a Knight: Then B's statement is true, meaning exactly one person is a Knight. Since A is a Knave and B is a Knight, then C must be a Knave. This gives us: A=Knave, B=Knight, C=Knave (exactly one Knight ✓)\n\nLet's test if B could be a Knave:\n- If B is a Knave: Then B's statement is false, meaning it's not true that exactly one is a Knight.

The total area is 108 square meters (vs. 96 in the first case), and each plot has an area of 9 square meters (vs. 16), so more plots are needed to cover the space. Specifically, the number of plots scales with the inverse of the GCD squared: in the first garden, both dimensions are divisible by 4, enabling fewer, larger plots; in the second, the width (9m) isn't divisible by 4, reducing the maximum square size and increasing the plot count proportionally.

Let dimensions be L and W. So, 2(L+W) = 100 => L+W = 50.\n*   **Flower Beds:** Two circular, non-overlapping, radius (r) = 8m each.\n*   **Gazebo:** Square, non-overlapping with flower beds.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize the side length (s) of the square gazebo.\n*   **Additional Goal:** Determine garden dimensions (L, W) that make this maximum achievable.\n\n**2. Area Considerations and Initial Thoughts:**\n\n*   Area of one flower bed = $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (8^2) = 64\\pi \\approx 201.06 m^2$.\n*   Total area of flower beds = $128\\pi \\approx 402.12 m^2$.\n*   The garden's area (L*W) must be large enough to accommodate these, plus the gazebo.\n*   To maximize the gazebo's side length, we want to maximize the \"empty\" space that can be shaped into a square. This often means placing the circular beds as far apart as possible, or in corners, to leave a large contiguous area.\n\n**3. Minimum Garden Dimensions for the Flower Beds:**\n\nFor two non-overlapping circles of radius 8m, the minimum dimension required in one direction is $2r + 2r = 4r = 32m$ (if placed side-by-side) or $2r = 16m$ (if placed one above the other).\n\n*   If we place them side-by-side along one dimension, say L, then L must be at least $2r+2r = 32m$.\n*   The other dimension, W, must be at least $2r = 16m$.\n*   So, a minimum garden size to *just* fit the two circles would be $32m \\times 16m$.\n*   Perimeter for $32m \\times 16m = 2(3",

A says, \"We are all Knaves.\" B says, \"Exactly one of us is a Knight.\" C says, \"B and I are different types.\" Determine the type of each person (Knight or Knave) and provide a step-by-step explanation of your reasoning, including why any assumptions or contradictions arise.\n",

Pipe A fills at a constant rate, while Pipe B's flow rate decreases by 10% each hour (compared to its previous hour's rate). When both pipes run together from the start, the pool fills in exactly 6 hours. When only Pipe A runs, it takes 10 hours to fill the pool. \n",
