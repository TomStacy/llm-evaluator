    "## What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetches Top Models** - Scrapes the current rankings from OpenRouter to identify the most popular models\n",
    "2. **Generates Questions** - Each model creates a challenging reasoning question\n",
    "3. **Answers Questions** - Each model answers all questions from other models\n",
    "4. **Evaluates Responses** - Each model rates the quality of all answers on a 10-point scale\n",
    "5. **Aggregates Results** - Produces comparison metrics and cross-model rating matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenRouter API Key**: Set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: pandas, requests, beautifulsoup4, playwright, openai (automatically installed with `uv sync`)"

    "```\n",

    "   - Set it as an environment variable:\n",
    "     - **Windows (PowerShell)**: `$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n",
    "     - **Mac/Linux**: `export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n",

    "## Fetch Top Models from OpenRouter\n",
    "\n",
    "This section scrapes the OpenRouter rankings page to get real-time popularity data based on actual usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fetch_openrouter_rankings()` function uses **Playwright** (a browser automation tool) to:\n",
    "1. Launch a headless browser\n",
    "2. Navigate to the OpenRouter rankings page\n",
    "3. Wait for JavaScript content to load\n",
    "4. Extract model data including rank, name, token usage, and usage trends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Playwright?** The rankings page uses JavaScript to render content dynamically, so we need a real browser to see the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows Event Loop Note:** Jupyter uses an asyncio event loop that conflicts with Playwright on Windows. The function runs Playwright in a separate thread with its own event loop to avoid this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Sorting Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fetch_top_openrouter_models()` function supports different sorting criteria:\n",
    "- **popularity** - Models ranked by actual usage on OpenRouter (default, uses Playwright scraping)\n",
    "- **price_low** - Cheapest models first\n",
    "- **price_high** - Most expensive (often most capable) models first  \n",
    "- **context_length** - Longest context window first\n",
    "- **newest** - Most recently added models first\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Only the popularity ranking requires Playwright. Other sorting options use the OpenRouter API directly."

The pool also has a drain that can empty the full pool in 12 hours. \n\nAt 8:00 AM, Pipe A is opened. At 9:00 AM, Pipe B is also opened. At 10:00 AM, someone accidentally opens the drain, which remains open.\n\nHowever, there's a complication: the pool has a capacity marker at the 75% level. Once the water reaches this marker, a float valve automatically reduces Pipe B's flow rate to half its original rate (Pipe A and the drain are unaffected).\n\n**Questions:**\n1. At what time does the water level reach the 75% marker?\n2. At what time is the pool completely full?\n3. If the pool's total capacity is 2,400 gallons, how many gallons did Pipe B contribute in total?\n\nShow your reasoning for each step, including how you account for the changing rates at different time periods and the flow rate reduction.",

Message A, when decrypted, reads: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" Message B, when decrypted, reads: \"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.\" The detective is informed that one message was generated by a human, and the other by a sophisticated AI designed to emulate human writing. Without knowing which is which, the detective correctly identifies the AI-generated message.\n\nBased *only* on the decrypted content, and assuming both messages are valid English sentences, what is the *most plausible* linguistic pattern the detective likely used to distinguish the AI-generated message, and why?

Meanwhile, a competitor's drug shows only 25% improvement but was tested on the full patient population including all excluded groups. \n\nAnalyze the ethical, statistical, and business implications of this scenario. What factors should guide the company's decision about how to market their drug, and how should healthcare providers and patients interpret and compare these competing claims?

This creates a contradiction because A > B > C implies A > C, but the ties suggest equality.\n   - If C defeats A in the unknown match (C > A), this creates a cycle: A > B > C > A. In a cycle, no strict ranking is possible without contradiction, as each player beats another in the chain.\n   - If A defeats C in the unknown match (A > C), this reinforces the transitive chain: A > B > C, with no contradictions.\n\n3. **Most Likely Ranking**:\n   - The only scenario that allows a consistent strict ranking from strongest to weakest is A > B > C, which requires A to win the unknown match against C.\n   - This is the most likely because it aligns with the established patterns (A's dominance over B and B's over C) without introducing inconsistencies. The two ties between A and C suggest closeness, but the overall evidence favors A as the strongest, followed by B, then C. Assuming the unknown match breaks the tie in favor of A avoids the logical issues in the other scenarios.\n   - Ties are not unavoidable here, as a consistent ranking is possible under this assumption.\n\n### Final Ranking\nA > B > C (strongest to weakest).",

(This seems to contradict the \"A and C tie twice\" statement. I will assume the \"A and C tie twice\" *is* the known result of their matches, and there are no other A vs C matches to consider.)\n\n**Interpretation of \"Most Likely Ranking\":**\n\nWe are looking for a ranking that best reflects the dominance shown in the head-to-head results. A win indicates superiority, and a tie indicates equality or very close strength.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **A vs. B:** A clearly dominates B, having beaten B twice. This establishes A > B.\n2.  **B vs. C:** B clearly dominates C, having beaten C twice. This establishes B > C.\n3.  **A vs. C:** A and C tied twice. This suggests they are of comparable strength, or at least that neither player definitively dominates the other. This establishes A ≈ C (A is approximately equal to C).\n\n**Combining the Relationships:**\n\n*   From (1) and (2), we have a clear transitive relationship: A > B and B > C. This implies A > B > C.\n*   However, relationship (3) introduces a nuance: A ≈ C.\n\n**Reconciling the Relationships:**\n\nIf A > B and B > C, then logically A should also be stronger than C (A > C). But the direct matches between A and C resulted in two ties.\n\nThis presents a slight contradiction if we assume strict transitivity. However, in sports, direct head-to-head results can sometimes differ from expected transitive outcomes. The \"most likely ranking\" should prioritize direct evidence.\n\nLet's consider the strength implied by wins:\n\n*   A has shown superiority over B.\n*   B has shown superiority over C.\n\nNow, consider A and C. They tied. This means neither player could consistently defeat the other. If A were significantly stronger than C, we would expect A to win at",

         "### Assumptions for Analysis\nTo determine the ranking, I assume a standard tournament scoring system: 1 point for a win, 0.5 points for a tie, and 0 for a loss. This is common for such scenarios and allows quantitative comparison. Rankings are based on total points; ties in total points are broken by head-to-head results (wins/ties against the tied opponent). \n\nThe given information implies the following matches:\n- A vs. B: 2 matches, both won by A (known).\n- B vs. C: 2 matches, both won by B (known).\n- A vs. C: 3 matches total—2 ties (known), 1 unknown result.\n\nThis setup is consistent with the phrasing (a \"series\" of matches, with one explicitly unknown A vs. C result). Each player thus plays 5 matches total (A and C play 5 each; B plays 4). No other matches exist based on the information provided.\n\nThe unknown A vs. C match has 3 possible outcomes (A wins, tie, or C wins). I evaluate all cases to find the ranking, then determine the \"most likely\" (i.e., the one occurring in the maximum number of scenarios, assuming equal likelihood of outcomes).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Known Points\n- A vs. B (2 matches): A = 2 points, B = 0 points.\n- B vs. C (2 matches): B = 2 points, C = 0 points.\n- A vs. C (2 ties): A = 1 point, C = 1 point.\n\n**Current totals (before unknown match)**:\n- A: 2 (vs. B) + 1 (vs. C) = 3 points.\n- B: 0 (vs. A) + 2 (vs. C) = 2 points.\n- C: 0 (vs. B) + 1 (vs. A) = 1 point.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate All Possible Outcomes of the Unknown A vs. C Match\nI compute final points and rankings for each case, applying tiebreakers where needed.\n\n- **Case 1: A wins the unknown match** (A +1, C +0).  \n  Final A vs. C points: A = 2, C = 1.  \n  **Totals**: A = 3 + 1 = 4; B",

         "Below is a thorough, structured answer to the questions. I'll reason step by step, including calculations for rates, time periods, and the flow rate reduction. All times are in hours from 8:00 AM (t=0). I'll use fractions where possible for precision and convert to decimals only when needed for clarity. The pool's full capacity is 1 pool unit for rate calculations, and the drain's effect is subtracted as a negative rate.\n\n### Key Rates and Assumptions\n- Pipe A fills the pool in 6 hours → rate = 1/6 pool/hour.\n- Pipe B fills the pool in 4 hours → rate = 1/4 pool/hour (until 75% is reached, then halves to 1/8 pool/hour).\n- Drain empties the pool in 12 hours → rate = 1/12 pool/hour (negative contribution).\n- Timeline phases:\n  - 0 ≤ t < 1: Only A (net rate = 1/6).\n  - 1 ≤ t < 2: A + B (net rate = 1/6 + 1/4 = 5/12).\n  - 2 ≤ t < 2.5: A + B + drain (net rate = 1/6 + 1/4 - 1/12 = 4/12 = 1/3). B is at full rate until t=2.5.\n  - t ≥ 2.5: A + B (at half rate) + drain (net rate = 1/6 + 1/8 - 1/12 = 4/24 + 3/24 - 2/24 = 5/24).\n- The pool reaches 75% at t=2.5 (calculated below), triggering B's rate reduction.\n\n### 1. At what time does the water level reach the 75% marker?\nWe need to find when the water level hits 75% (0.75 pool units). Calculate the level cumulatively by phase.\n\n- **0 ≤ t < 1 (only A):** Water level at t=1: (1/6) × 1 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 pool units.\n- **1 ≤ t < 2 (A + B):** Water level at t=2: (1/6) + (5/12) × 1 = 1/6 + 5",

         "### Identification of the AI-Generated Message\nBased on the decrypted content and assuming both are valid English sentences, the most plausible linguistic pattern the detective used is the **degree of stylistic naturalness and lexical simplicity**, specifically identifying **Message B (\"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow\") as AI-generated**. This is because Message B exhibits a more abstract, archaic, and poetically forced structure with uncommon vocabulary, which is a common artifact of AI text generation attempting to emulate human creativity. In contrast, Message A flows as a straightforward, narrative sentence using everyday words and simple syntax, aligning more with typical human writing.\n\n### Justification: Comparison of Linguistic Features\nTo reason this out, I'll compare key features related to human vs. AI text generation patterns, drawing on established observations from AI detection research (e.g., studies on language models like GPT, which often aim to mimic human output but reveal patterns in fluency, vocabulary choice, and thematic depth). Both messages are short pangrams (sentences using all letters of the alphabet), but pangrams are inherently constructed, so the detective likely focused on how naturally human-like the content feels beyond that shared trait.\n\n#### 1. **Lexical Choice and Vocabulary Variety**\n   - **Message A**: Uses highly common, monosyllabic words (e.g., \"the,\" \"fox,\" \"jumps,\" \"dog\") that are frequent in everyday English. This reflects human writing's tendency to rely on familiar, accessible vocabulary for clarity and relatability, especially in simple, illustrative sentences. No words feel forced or rare; it's a classic example of concise, practical language.\n   - **Message B**: Incorporates less common or more formal/archaic terms (e.g., \"Sphinx\" as a mythical creature, \"quartz\" as a mineral, \"vow\" implying a solemn pledge). These are rarer in casual human text and suggest an attempt at variety or sophistication to cover all letters, which can result in unnatural word selection. AI models, trained on diverse corpora, often overcompensate by selecting statistically \"interesting\" words to avoid monotony, leading to text that feels artificially elevated or contrived.\n   - **Human vs. AI Relevance**: Humans typically use words that fit context naturally (e.g., describing a scene), while AI may prioritize diversity or rarity to emulate creativity, resulting in \"creative\" but detached choices. This pattern is noted in AI detection tools like those analyzing perplexity or word frequency distributions, where AI text deviates from",

This reveals:\n- **Mechanical purpose**: Created to demonstrate completeness rather than communicate meaning\n- **Unnatural scenario**: The sentence describes an implausible scene with no real-world context\n- **Formulaic recognition**: It's a well-known test sentence used in typography, keyboards, and crucially, **AI training datasets**\n\n**Message B** (\"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow\"), while also a pangram, has:\n- **Poetic structure**: Resembles an invocation or dramatic statement\n- **Human creativity markers**: The unusual imagery suggests artistic intent\n- **Less mechanical feel**: Though constructed, it mimics human creative expression\n\n### 2. **Contextual Authenticity**\n\nA sophisticated detective would recognize that:\n\n**AI systems** are frequently trained on and tested with pangrams like Message A. When asked to generate \"valid English sentences,\" an AI might:\n- Default to well-represented patterns in training data\n- Produce technically perfect but contextually hollow sentences\n- Generate the \"quick brown fox\" as it's overrepresented in linguistic corpora\n\n**Human writers** rarely produce Message A spontaneously because:\n- It serves no communicative function\n- Humans write with intent (to inform, persuade, express)\n- Message B, despite being artificial, shows more creative human impulse\n\n### 3. **Statistical Likelihood**\n\nThe detective likely reasoned:\n- **Message A**: Probability of random human generation ≈ near zero (why would someone write this?)\n- **Message B**: Shows deliberate wordplay/creativity that humans engage in\n- An AI tasked with \"generating a valid sentence\" might retrieve a canonical example from its training\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe detective identified Message A as AI-generate",

A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.\n*   **Relevance to AI vs. Human:**\n    *   **Human Generation:** While humans *can* create pangrams, they are almost exclusively constructed for specific, often technical or demonstrative purposes (e.g., testing fonts, typing practice, cryptographic examples). They are not typical, natural human communication. A human writing a general sentence would rarely, if ever, spontaneously produce a perfect pangram unless intentionally trying to do so.\n    *   **AI Generation:** Sophisticated AI, especially those designed to \"emulate human writing\" or demonstrate linguistic capabilities, are often trained on vast datasets and can be programmed or fine-tuned to achieve specific linguistic feats. Generating a pangram could be a deliberate demonstration of its ability to cover a wide range of characters, or it could arise from internal algorithms that prioritize character diversity for testing or completeness. It represents a kind of \"engineered\" linguistic output rather than organic expression.\n\n**Message B: \"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.\"**\n\n*   **Linguistic Feature:** This sentence is also a pangram, specifically a **perfect pangram** (using each letter only once, or as few times as possible, often cited as the shortest perfect pangram in English).\n*   **Relevance to AI vs. Human:**\n    *   **Human Generation:** Similar to Message A, generating a perfect pangram is an extremely artificial and constrained task for a human. It requires deliberate effort, planning, and often multiple revisions to achieve. It's not a natural output of human communication.\n    *   **AI Generation:** For the same reasons as Message A, an AI might generate this.

Modern AI (e.g., transformer-based models like GPT) excels at syntactic correctness and lexical diversity but often produces text that feels \"engineered\" under implicit constraints, such as covering a broad vocabulary (here, implied by both being pangrams). Humans, by contrast, favor familiar patterns from memory and cultural exposure, even in creative tasks.

This reflects human tendencies to draw from memorized templates or oral traditions, producing text that \"flows\" intuitively.\n   - **Message B**: Relies on low-probability, ad-hoc collocations that feel assembled rather than organic:\n     - \"Sphinx of black quartz\" combines a mythological noun (\"sphinx\") with a prepositional phrase using \"black quartz\" (a mineral descriptor), which is semantically awkward—quartz isn't a typical attribute for a sphinx (more associated with stone or riddles,",

         "### Ethical Implications\n\nThe pharmaceutical company's marketing of \"40% faster recovery\" raises concerns about honesty and patient autonomy. Ethically, advertising a benefit derived from a non-representative sample (excluding 60% of the target population) could mislead patients and prescribers, potentially leading to harm if the drug is less effective or unsafe for excluded groups (e.g., elderly patients or those with comorbidities). This violates principles like beneficence (do no harm) and non-maleficence from medical ethics frameworks such as those in the Declaration of Helsinki. The medical team's caution highlights a duty to provide accurate information, whereas aggressive marketing prioritizes profit over transparency. For the competitor, testing on the full population promotes inclusivity, aligning with equitable access to healthcare, but their lower improvement rate might still be ethically preferable if it reflects real-world applicability.\n\n### Statistical Implications\n\nThe 40% recovery rate improvement is statistically valid only for the trial's subset (likely a selected, healthier group), limiting generalizability. This is an issue of external validity: the results may not hold for the broader population due to confounding factors like age-related pharmacokinetics or interactions with blood thinners. In contrast, the competitor's 25% improvement, tested on the full population, offers better external validity, though it might underestimate benefits in healthier subgroups or overestimate risks in vulnerable ones. Direct comparisons are flawed without adjusted analyses (e.g., subgroup effect sizes or meta-analyses). Effect sizes should be reported with confidence intervals and p-values; the company's claim could be statistically significant in trials but clinically misleading if absolute benefits are small. Regulatory bodies like the FDA require fair balance in advertising, emphasizing that claims must be supported by substantial evidence.\n\n### Business Implications\n\nMarketing the drug as \"40% faster recovery\" could drive short-term sales and market share by appealing to patients seeking quick fixes, potentially outperforming the competitor's more conservative 25% claim. However, this risks legal repercussions, such as FDA enforcement actions for false advertising (e.g., under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act), lawsuits from harmed patients, or boycotts from healthcare providers. Long-term, eroding trust could lead to brand damage, reduced physician prescribing, and higher regulatory scrutiny in future approvals. The competitor's inclusive trials might foster goodwill, aiding partnerships with payers and prescribers, but their lower efficacy might position them as a \"safer\" alternative, especially if the company's exclusions signal hidden risks.

         "This scenario presents a complex ethical, statistical, and business dilemma with far-reaching implications.\n\n## Analysis of Implications:\n\n**1. Ethical Implications:**\n\n*   **Misleading Advertising:** The marketing team's desire to advertise \"40% faster recovery\" is ethically problematic. By omitting crucial context (the exclusion of 60% of the target population), the claim becomes a partial truth, which is often more deceptive than an outright lie. It exploits the public's trust in scientific claims.\n*   **Patient Harm:** If patients outside the tested demographic (over 65, kidney disease, blood thinners) are prescribed the drug based on this unqualified claim, they might not experience the advertised benefit, or worse, could suffer adverse effects due to unstudied interactions or comorbidities. This directly impacts patient safety and well-being.\n*   **Informed Consent:** Healthcare providers and patients cannot make truly informed decisions if the efficacy data is selectively presented.\n*   **Erosion of Trust:** Misleading claims erode public trust in pharmaceutical companies, medical research, and even the healthcare system as a whole. This can have long-term negative consequences for public health initiatives and patient compliance.\n*   **Research Integrity:** Deliberately obscuring limitations in clinical trials undermines the integrity of medical research. It sets a dangerous precedent where commercial interests trump scientific rigor and transparency.\n\n**2. Statistical Implications:**\n\n*   **External Validity (Generalizability):** The primary statistical issue is the severe limitation of external validity.

         "### Ethical Implications\nEthically, the scenario raises concerns about transparency, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Advertising \"40% faster recovery\" without qualifying the trial exclusions could mislead patients and providers into assuming broad applicability, violating principles like informed consent and the Hippocratic oath's emphasis on \"do no harm.\" The excluded groups (60% of the target population) include vulnerable elderly and comorbid patients, potentially exacerbating health disparities if the drug is prescribed off-label without evidence. This prioritizes profit over patient welfare, akin to historical pharma scandals (e.g., Vioxx), where selective data promotion led to harm. The medical team's objection aligns with ethical standards from bodies like the AMA, which mandate accurate representation of risks and benefits.\n\n### Statistical Implications\nStatistically, the 40% improvement is subject to selection bias, as trials focused on a healthier subset (40% of the population), inflating efficacy estimates. This creates a non-representative sample: the true effect size in the full population may be lower (possibly closer to or below the competitor's 25%), due to untested interactions in excluded groups (e.g., reduced clearance in kidney disease). Direct comparison is invalid without adjustment—e.g., via subgroup analysis or meta-analysis—highlighting issues like generalizability and external validity. Confidence intervals around the 40% figure might not overlap with real-world data, and without intention-to-treat analysis including dropouts, the results could overestimate benefits. The competitor's 25% on a diverse population offers better ecological validity, though it may dilute average effects due to heterogeneity.\n\n### Business Implications\nFrom a business perspective, aggressive marketing could drive short-term revenue through higher market share and prescription volumes, especially if \"40% faster\" resonates in direct-to-consumer ads. However, risks include regulatory scrutiny (e.g., FDA warnings or ad pulls under 21 CFR 202.1), class-action lawsuits for false advertising, and competitive retaliation. Long-term, reputational damage could erode brand loyalty—e.g., a 2023 study in *JAMA* linked misleading claims to 15-20% drops in future sales. Conversely, transparent marketing (e.g., \"40% in select patients\") might build trust, fostering loyalty and enabling premium pricing for a \"targeted\" therapy, while positioning the company as ethical amid rising ESG investor pressures.\n\n### Factors Guiding the Company's Marketing Decision\nThe company's decision should prioritize:\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhere to FDA/EMA guidelines",

      "**Question:** In a tournament where three players—A, B, and C—each compete in a series of one-on-one matches with the following outcomes: A beats B twice, B beats C twice, and A and C tie twice. Unknown is the result of A's match against C. Using only this information, determine the most likely ranking of the players from strongest to weakest, justifying your reasoning step by step. If ties are unavoidable, explain the constraints.\n",

      "**Question:** A rectangular swimming pool is being filled by two pipes. Pipe A can fill the pool in 6 hours, and Pipe B can fill it in 4 hours. The pool also has a drain that can empty the full pool in 12 hours. \n",
      "\n",
      "At 8:00 AM, Pipe A is opened. At 9:00 AM, Pipe B is also opened. At 10:00 AM, someone accidentally opens the drain, which remains open.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there's a complication: the pool has a capacity marker at the 75% level. Once the water reaches this marker, a float valve automatically reduces Pipe B's flow rate to half its original rate (Pipe A and the drain are unaffected).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Questions:**\n",
      "1. At what time does the water level reach the 75% marker?\n",
      "2. At what time is the pool completely full?\n",
      "3. If the pool's total capacity is 2,400 gallons, how many gallons did Pipe B contribute in total?\n",
      "\n",
      "Show your reasoning for each step, including how you account for the changing rates at different time periods and the flow rate reduction.\n",

      "**Question:** A renowned fictional detective, known for solving crimes based on subtle linguistic patterns, is presented with two encrypted messages. Message A, when decrypted, reads: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" Message B, when decrypted, reads: \"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.\" The detective is informed that one message was generated by a human, and the other by a sophisticated AI designed to emulate human writing. Without knowing which is which, the detective correctly identifies the AI-generated message.\n",

      "Based *only* on the decrypted content, and assuming both messages are valid English sentences, what is the *most plausible* linguistic pattern the detective likely used to distinguish the AI-generated message, and why?

The company's marketing team wants to advertise \"40% faster recovery\" while the medical team argues this is misleading. Meanwhile, a competitor's drug shows only 25% improvement but was tested on the full patient population including all excluded groups. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analyze the ethical, statistical, and business implications of this scenario. What factors should guide the company's decision about how to market their drug, and how should healthcare providers and patients interpret and compare these competing claims?

    "## Interpretation & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Do These Results Tell Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Average Ratings** - Higher average ratings suggest models that consistently provide well-reasoned, complete answers\n",
    "2. **Cross-Model Matrix** - Shows agreement/disagreement between raters. High variance may indicate:\n",
    "   - Different evaluation standards between models\n",
    "   - Genuine quality differences in answers\n",
    "   - Bias toward certain answer styles\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Self-Ratings vs Peer-Ratings** - Reveals whether models are overconfident, overly critical, or fair\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Size**: Results are based on a small number of questions (N models = N questions)\n",
    "- **Question Quality**: The evaluation quality depends on how good the generated questions are\n",
    "- **Rater Bias**: Models may have inherent biases in how they evaluate responses\n",
    "- **Domain Coverage**: Questions may cluster in certain domains based on model training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideas for Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase Sample Size**: Run with more questions per model (requires API credits)\n",
    "2. **Domain-Specific Evaluation**: Test models on specific domains (math, coding, creative writing)\n",
    "3. **Human Validation**: Compare model ratings with human expert ratings\n",
    "4. **Consistency Testing**: Run the same evaluation multiple times to check stability\n",
    "5. **Cost Analysis**: Track token usage and costs to compute value-per-dollar\n",
    "6. **Response Time Analysis**: Compare speed vs quality tradeoffs\n",
    "7. **Temperature Experiments**: Test how different temperature settings affect question/answer quality\n",
    "\n",
